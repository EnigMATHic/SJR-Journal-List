# SJR-Journal-List

This code is moving towards answering the question:
    How many journals (from 4 different publishers) are in the top decile?

Typical approaches have involved using Excel to get the journal titles from the publisher webpages. 
Including Springer Nature (Springer Open; BioMed Central; 
Palgrave; Nature Journals - 1-4 will be added â€“ only fully open access journals); 
Wiley (Open Access Journals & Open Online Journals); 
Taylor & Francis (Open; & Open Select); and PLOS (Link).

Scimago has downloadable spreadsheets from which the top decile journals may be determined based on the designated 
Subject Area (27 listed) for measuring the top decile journals (the top 10% of journals from each of these lists = top decile journals).
